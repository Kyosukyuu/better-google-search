Better Google Search

Adds useful features for google searching. English support only. Tested on Brave Browser. Intended to work with light mode and dark mode. Doesn't work on mobile view.

I recommend you use this on a modern, updated web browser to ensure it can run ES6 code.

If you're looking to download this on something like TamperMonkey or ViolentMonkey, you can also download it [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/437567-better-google-search)
